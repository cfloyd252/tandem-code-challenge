## Hello

It seems as if the features I had planned for this code challenge were too ambitious for the 
time frame given. I'm assuming that I will no longer be considered for the apprenticeship 
due to not having a functioning program by the deadline. In any case, I shall continue working 
on this project as something to add to my portfolio. I would also be open to any feedback.

Thanks for your time and consideration,

Christopher Floyd
